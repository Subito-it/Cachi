# Installation

```
brew install Subito-it/made/cachi
```

Or you can build manually using swift build.


# Usage

Cachi can be launched by passing the port for the web interface and the location where it should search for the .xcresult bundles.

You can optionally pass `--search_depth` to specify how deep Cachi should traverse the location path. Default is 2, larger values may impact parsing speed. 

```bash
$ cachi --port number [--search_depth level] path
```
